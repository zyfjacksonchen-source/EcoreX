## 🏗️ Architecture

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhayujie/cowagent-assets@main/architecture/en/architecture.jpg" alt="CowAgent Architecture" width="750"/>

CowAgent is a complete **Agent Harness**: messages flow in through **Channels**; the **Agent Core** plans and reasons over memory, knowledge, and the available tools and skills; **Models** generate the response, which is sent back through the originating channel. Every layer is decoupled and independently extensible.

Read more in [Architecture](https://docs.cowagent.ai/intro/architecture).

<br/>

## 🚀 Quick Start

A one-line installer takes care of dependencies, configuration, and startup:

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/run.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/run.ps1 | iex
```

**Docker:**

```bash
curl -O https://cdn.link-ai.tech/code/cow/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Once started, open `http://localhost:9899` to access the **Web console** — your one-stop hub to chat with the Agent, configure models, connect channels, and install skills.

> Deploying on a server? Set `web_host` to `0.0.0.0` in `config.json` to make the console reachable from outside, and set `web_password` to protect it. Don't forget to open port `9899` in your firewall or security group.

> 📖 Detailed guides: [Quick Start](https://docs.cowagent.ai/guide/quick-start) · [Install from Source](https://docs.cowagent.ai/guide/manual-install) · [Upgrade](https://docs.cowagent.ai/guide/upgrade)

After installation, manage the service with the [cow CLI](https://docs.cowagent.ai/cli/index):

```bash
cow start | stop | restart        # service control
cow status | logs                  # status and logs
cow update                         # pull latest code and restart
cow skill install <name>           # install a skill
cow install-browser                # install browser automation
```

<br/>

## 🤖 Models

CowAgent supports all mainstream LLM providers. **Chat, vision, image generation, ASR/TTS, and embeddings** can each be routed to a different vendor. Providers are configured directly in the Web console — no manual file editing required.

| Provider | Featured Models | Chat | Vision | Image Gen | ASR | TTS | Embedding |

## 💬 Channels

A single Agent instance can serve multiple channels in parallel. Most channels can be onboarded right from the Web console.

| Channel | Text | Image | File | Voice | Group |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [Web Console](https://docs.cowagent.ai/channels/web) (default) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | |

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhayujie/cowagent-assets@main/screenshots/en/web-console-chat.png" alt="CowAgent Web Console" width="800"/>

*The Web console is the default channel and the unified entry point to configure models, channels, skills, memory, and more.*

<br/>

## 🧠 Memory & Knowledge Base

**Long-term memory** uses a three-tier architecture: conversation context (short-term) → daily memory (mid-term) → MEMORY.md (long-term). A nightly **Deep Dream** pass distills scattered memories into refined long-term entries and a narrative journal. See [Long-term Memory](https://docs.cowagent.ai/memory/index) · [Deep Dream](https://docs.cowagent.ai/memory/deep-dream).

**Personal knowledge base** complements the time-ordered memory by organizing structured knowledge **by topic**. The Agent automatically curates valuable information from conversations, maintains cross-references and indexes, and the Web console offers an interactive knowledge-graph view. See [Personal Knowledge Base](https://docs.cowagent.ai/knowledge/index).

## 🔧 Tools & Skills

**Tools** are atomic capabilities the Agent uses to interact with system resources. **Skills** are higher-level workflows defined by a manifest file that compose multiple tools to accomplish complex tasks.

### Tool System

**Built-in tools** cover file I/O (`read` / `write` / `edit` / `ls`), terminal (`bash`), file sending (`send`), memory retrieval (`memory`), environment variables (`env_config`), web fetching (`web_fetch`), scheduling (`scheduler`), web search (`web_search`), vision (`vision`), and browser automation (`browser`).

**MCP protocol** integrates the open ecosystem of [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers. A single `mcp.json` is enough — supports stdio / SSE transports, hot reload, and zero-code integration.

Learn more: [Tools overview](https://docs.cowagent.ai/tools/index) · [MCP integration](https://docs.cowagent.ai/tools/mcp).

### Skills System

- **[Skill Hub](https://skills.cowagent.ai/)** — open skill marketplace: browse, search, install in one click
- **GitHub / ClawHub / URL and more** — install skills from any source
- **Conversational authoring** — generate custom skills through dialogue with `skill-creator`; turn any workflow or third-party API into a reusable skill

```bash
/skill list                   # list installed skills
/skill search <keyword>        # search the marketplace
/skill install <name>          # one-click install
```
